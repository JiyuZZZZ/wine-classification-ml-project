# 🍷 Wine Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project applies and compares several machine learning classification algorithms  
on the **UCI Wine dataset**, including a **decision tree implemented from scratch**.

The aim is to evaluate the learning performance of different models,  
tune their hyperparameters, and assess results through robust statistical evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- ✅ Decision Tree (custom Python implementation)
- ✅ Naïve Bayes
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ✅ Neural Network (using sklearn / Keras)

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- F-score
- ROC Curve
- 10-Fold Cross-Validation

---

## 🧪 Project Highlights

- A custom `DecisionTreeClassifier` class was written in pure Python (`dt.py`)  
- Used 10-fold cross-validation for all models
- ROC and F-score visualizations included
- Hyperparameter tuning for all algorithms
- Clear performance comparison and analysis of results
